## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I guess some of the things I've never done before are the text-dectorations, line-height variations, and text transform. They're really simple skills, but I haven't really used them in any project I've done. 

```css
.examples{
  text-transform: uppercase;
  line-height: 23px;
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```

### Continued development

It's always really helpful to practice using @media quaries.

### Useful resources
